# **Leveraging AI and Blockchain for Financial Chart Analysis**

Welcome to our innovative web application that combines the power of artificial intelligence with the security and transparency of blockchain technology to revolutionize financial analysis.

### **Overview**

In the rapidly evolving world of finance, the ability to quickly interpret and act on complex financial data is critical. With the rise of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we asked ourselves: **Can an LLM analyze financial charts and derive actionable strategies?**

To explore this, we developed an application using modern web technologies, including Vite, React, and TypeScript. Our app integrates the Galadrielle protocol to send requests to LLMs via blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability. Additionally, BNB Greenfield is used for storing and securing the financial strategies generated by the LLMs.

### **Backtesting on BTC - USDC**

The application includes a section dedicated to backtesting strategies on the BTC - USDC pair, covering over 3 years of historical data. This allows users to assess the robustness and performance of their strategies before deploying them in real time, helping to evaluate risks and optimize strategies based on past market conditions.

### **Adding Custom Strategies**

Users can create and add their own strategies via the interface. These strategies are then securely stored on BNB Greenfield, guaranteeing data confidentiality and integrity. This functionality allows each user to tailor the application to their specific needs and fully leverage the benefits of AI in financial management.

### **Connection via Wallet (MetaMask)**

To enhance security and decentralization, our application supports connection via decentralized wallets such as MetaMask. This provides access to the application's features and enables secure transaction signing and authorization on the blockchain. Integration with WalletConnect also facilitates connections with a variety of compatible wallets.

### **Key Features**

- **AI-Powered Financial Analysis**: Leverage the power of advanced LLMs to analyze complex financial charts and generate insights and strategies.
- **Blockchain-Integrated Requests**: The Galadrielle protocol ensures that all AI requests and responses are recorded on the blockchain, offering unparalleled transparency and auditability.
- **Secure Strategy Storage**: BNB Greenfield ensures that all strategies are securely stored in a decentralized manner.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, TypeScript
- **AI & Blockchain**: Galadrielle for LLM requests via blockchain
- **Storage**: BNB Greenfield for decentralized strategy storage

# Technical Setup

To start using our application, follow the steps below to configure and launch the application. This section will guide you through setting up your environment variables, configuring the necessary services and running the application using Bun.

#### **Configuration**

Before running the application, ensure you have correctly configured your environment variables. Use the provided `.env.template` file as a reference and fill in the necessary values:

```.env
# Wallet Connect
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=

# Pinata / IPFS
VITE_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=

# Galadriel
VITE_OPEN_AI_VISION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=

# Wallet Private Key (requires GAL from the Galadriel faucet)
VITE_WALLET_PK=

# BNB Greenfield (default testnet configuration)
VITE_GRPC_URL=https://gnfd-testnet-fullnode-tendermint-ap.bnbchain.org
VITE_GREENFIELD_RPC_URL=https://gnfd-testnet-fullnode-tendermint-ap.bnbchain.org
VITE_GREEN_CHAIN_ID=5600
VITE_BSC_RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
VITE_BSC_CHAIN_ID=97

```

1) **VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID**: Your WalletConnect Project ID for connecting wallets.
2) VITE_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT**: JWT token for Pinata to manage IPFS file storage.
3) **VITE_OPEN_AI_VISION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Contract address for the Galadriel LLM vision component.
4) **VITE_WALLET_PK**: Private key of your wallet, used for signing transactions on the Galadriel blockchain. Ensure your wallet has some GAL tokens from the Galadriel faucet.
5) **BNB Greenfield and BSC Configurations**: Configuration details for interacting with the BNB Greenfield and BSC testnets.

Place your configured `.env` file in the root of your project.

#### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Bun installed. You can install it via:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

#### **Running the Application**

Once your environment is set up and you have Bun installed, you can start the application with the following commands:

- **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
bun install
```

- **Start the Development Server**:
```bash
 bun run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server. By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### **Next Steps**

With your application now configured and running, you can begin leveraging the power of AI and blockchain for financial analysis. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check your environment variables and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
